# Wildlife Classifier

Simple wildlife classifier trained on data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/travisdaws/spatiotemporal-wildlife-dataset.

Source code can be found at https://github.com/tandrewng/Wildlife-Categorizer

If interacting with the model, it is recommended to use images from the validation set on the data linked above as the model was not trained on those and they are labeled according to their parent folder.

IMO the model is not very good nor accurate as it has a roughly 1/8 chance of being incorrect, typically pretty ok at guessing the family/genus but poor at differentiating species.

Also, I am not by any means a biologist in any stretch of the word. I cannot tell the difference between a cat and a linx, etc. This is an exercise in creating a bot that can do which I have no hope in doing on my own. If you have any ways you think I can improve this model or just like to chat, reach me at tandrewng@gmail.com <3

Otherwise, please enjoy my work and have a good one, cheers.
